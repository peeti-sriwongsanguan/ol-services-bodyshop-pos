# A cloud-based POS API system for O.L Services
## O.L. Services is a Bodyshop & Repair, mainly for Truck 
## 6-Month Development Proposal and Roadmap

### Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive 6-month development plan for a cloud-based Point of Sale (POS) API system tailored specifically for bodyshop and collision service businesses. The system will feature a monolithic architecture initially, with multilingual support (English and Thai), and will be designed to operate on smartphones and tablets. Python will serve as the primary development language, with PostgreSQL on AWS RDS for database management and Kafka for real-time data synchronization.

2. Create a responsive, user-friendly mobile interface accessible on smartphones and tablets
3. Implement multilingual support for English and Thai languages
4. Establish real-time data synchronization using Kafka
5. Deploy the application on AWS cloud infrastructure
6. Deliver a complete, tested, and documented system within 6 months
